## Troubleshooting

### Precision Error

If you encounter the error "Precision is over the maximum defined for this asset", it means the quantity precision is too high for the asset you're trading. This can happen when:

1. Your investment amount is too small
2. The risk per trade is too small
3. The asset price is too high

The bot now automatically handles precision requirements for each asset by:
1. Retrieving the correct precision requirements from Binance
2. Adjusting position sizes to meet minimum quantity requirements
3. Ensuring orders meet minimum notional value requirements
4. Automatically retrying with adjusted precision if an error occurs

If you still encounter precision errors, try these solutions:
- Increase your investment amount (use the `--investment` flag)
- Try a different trading pair with a lower price
- Run in test mode first to verify settings (`--test` flag)

### Minimum Position Size Requirements

Binance has minimum requirements for order sizes:

1. **Minimum Quantity**: Each trading pair has a minimum quantity (e.g., 0.001 for SOLUSDT)
2. **Minimum Notional Value**: The order value (quantity Ã— price) must exceed a minimum amount (e.g., $10)

If your calculated position size is too small, you might see errors like:
- "Quantity less than or equal to zero"
- "Order value is below minimum notional"

The bot now automatically handles these requirements by:
1. Checking if the calculated position size meets minimum requirements
2. Adjusting the position size upward if needed
3. Using the minimum valid quantity as a fallback

For high-priced assets like SOLUSDT (>$150), we recommend:
- Using an investment amount of at least $100
- Setting leverage to 20x
- Using a risk per trade of at least 2%

### Other Common Issues

#### API Key Permissions
Make sure your Binance API key has the correct permissions:
- Read permissions for market data
- Trading permissions for executing orders
- If using futures, ensure futures trading is enabled for your API key

#### Network Issues
If you encounter connection errors, check your internet connection and Binance API status.
